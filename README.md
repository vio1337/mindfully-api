# Mindfully API
>You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather.
>— Pema Chödrön

This project found its roots in my disgruntled disappointment for lack of a reflective, compassionate and easily accesible quotes API. Perhaps my google-searching could be stronger. Alas, regardless of the cause, it birthed Mindfully-API: _Mindfulness-based quotes API designed to encourage greater reflection, empowerment, motivation, compassion and acceptance — cornerstones for developing a life of personal design._

## Configuration
